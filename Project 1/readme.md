### Abstract

This project aimed to examine using Vartiational Monte Carlo (VMC) in making an estimate, $\bar E$, of the ground state energy, $E_0$, of a trapped, hard sphere Bose gas. The error of the energy estimate was evaluated by using the sample error with "blocking", $\hat \sigma$. This method accounts for sample correlation, which was concluded to be necessary as the raw sample error was largely deceptive. Two approaches to the sampling scheme involved in the Metropolis algorithm were used, "Importance Sampling" and the "Brute Force" approach. "Importance sampling" was found to equilbrate the system faster than the "Brute Force" approach, albeit only for suitable values of $\Delta t$. Several other parameters, such as the number of particles, $N$ and the value $\alpha$ was observed to affect the suitability of different $\Delta t$ values. Increases in particle number, $N$, was generally observed to increase $\hat \sigma$; after $2^{18}$ Monte Carlo cycles, $\hat \sigma \sim 10^3$ ($N=10$) increased to $\sim 10^2$ ($N=50$) and $\sim 10^{-1}$ ($N=100$), both with and without the Jastrow factor, which accounts for particle-particle correlation.  Incorporating the Jastrow factor was concluded to have an increasing effect on the average estimated energy per particle $\bar E /N$ as $N$ increased, from $\bar E/N\approx2.45\approx$ constant for all values of $N$, to $4.55$ ($N=50$) and $2.66$ ($N=100$). This impact dependence was further verified by qualitative comparison of one-body densities.
