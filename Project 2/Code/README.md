Class structure forked from https://github.com/mortele/variational-monte-carlo-fys4411, then tailored to this specific project.

### Compiling the project using CMake
In a Linux/Mac terminal this can be done by the following commands
```bash
# Create build-directory
mkdir build

# Move into the build-directory
cd build

# Run CMake to create a Makefile
cmake ../

# Make the Makefile using two threads
make -j2

# Move the executable to the top-directory
mv vmc ..
```
Or, simply run the script `compile_project` via
```bash
./compile_project
```
and the same set of commands are done for you. Now the project can be run by executing
```bash
./vmc
```
in the top-directory.
